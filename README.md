 App Marketing Summary:
App marketing is an always-on messaging or marketing campaign that's designed to be displayed to your targeted audiences in different external Ad placements or while they're actively using your app, App Marketing Primary objective is building an engaged App User base with minimal churned users by driving quality users into retained app customers.
App marketing drives value into your brand shopping app by acquiring valuable relevant users to be engaging with your app and constantly connected with the latest features and promos.
Think of App Marketing as a “funnel.” in a simplified view.

● Re-marketing: a campaign type from different user touchpoints to drive in-app purchases.
● Retention: is earned through relevant experiences that drive user retention and brand
advocacy, mainly using customer retention channels like app push and email.
 
 App Marketing KPIs (Glossary) Traffic Metrics:

● Stickiness (DAU/MAU, WAU/MAU): Calculated to under a subset of active users. To understand daily active users from a monthly set, we use DAU / MAU. Similarly, we can also look at weekly active users from a monthly active set using WAU / MAU.
